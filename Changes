    - This extension is now implemented a role metarole, which means it can
      (mostly) cooperate with other role extensions, such as
      MooseX::Role::WithOverloading. Note that you should load
      MooseX::Role::Parameterized _after_ other extensions.
    - This module no longer supports passing a "-metaclass" parameter when you
      load it. This was an artifact from a much earlier era of Moose
      extensions.
    - repository migrated to the github moose organization

    - set %INC entries in test to avoid failures with
      Moose pre-2.11 (kentfrederic)
        https://github.com/sartak/MooseX-Role-Parameterized/pull/7
        https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=88593

1.01    2013-09-10
    - removed use of deprecated Class::MOP::load_class (ether)

1.00    2012-01-12
    - MooseX::Role::Parameterized now depends on Moose 2.0300
      released 2011-09-23 for its several core improvements, hence the
      major version number bump.

    - MXRP now uses the new meta_lookup feature added to Moose 2.0300
      (specifically for MXRP) to avoid duplicating Moose-0.60-era
      Moose::Role sugar. This means the error messages you get are
      better, and there's a lot less ugly code in MXRP.
    - Remove alias/excludes special case errors. They have long since been
      replaced in core Moose by -alias and -excludes, and were finally
      removed in Moose 2.0200.
    - Expressly forbid using role { } inside role { } (which makes no
      sense but I suppose you could accidentally trigger it)
    - Documentation fix from cweyl@alumni.drew.edu

0.27    2011-08-22
    - Remove MooseX::Role::Parameterized::Meta::Parameter; instead,
      the default for parameters of (is => 'ro') is set by the
      "parameter" sugar. This removes an unnecessary metaclass and
      removes weird edge cases caused by it. Please please please
      report any breakage!

0.04    2009-01-30
    - The role block now receives as an argument the consuming class or role.

0.03    2009-01-17
    - Parameters now default to read-only, so that you no longer have to specify
      the extremely common case of: is => 'ro'

0.02    2008-12-09
    - Using keywords outside of the role block is now allowed and handled.

    - The role generated by the role block is now composed with its parent role.
      This is so you can have unparameterized components to your parameterized
      roles, and so that does_role returns true if you ask about the parent
      role (instead of the anonymous parameterized role).
